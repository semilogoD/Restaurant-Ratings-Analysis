## Introduction:

This project analyses the Restaurant Rating Dataset, which contains detailed information on restaurants in Mexico City, based on a customer survey conducted in 2012. The dataset includes restaurant features (e.g., cuisine types, bar availability, price range), consumer demographics, and customer preferences.

As a Data Analyst, the goal of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights that can aid business entrepreneurs and investors in making informed decisions, such as identifying demand-supply gaps, understanding consumer behaviour, and determining key characteristics of top-rated restaurants.


## Key Objectives:

-	Identify consumer preferences and their impact on restaurant ratings

-	Detect demographic biases in the dataset

-	Uncover business opportunities through demand-supply gap analysis

-	Recommend ideal restaurant characteristics for potential investors

## Skills/Concepts demonstrated:
- Data Importing
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Data Extraction and Manipulation
- Joins 
- Aggregation and Grouping
- Performance optimization

## Analysis:
### What can you learn from the highest-rated restaurants?  Do consumer preferences affect ratings? 

Yes, consumer preferences do influence restaurant ratings. Most highly rated restaurants serve Mexican cuisine, which aligns with the dominant consumer preference. This suggests that meeting customer tastes, particularly the demand for Mexican food, positively impacts restaurant ratings.

### What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample? 

The dataset exhibits a geographic bias because a disproportionate number of consumers are from San Luis Potosí City. This overrepresentation skews the data, making it less reflective of the broader consumer population across different regions. 

As a result, any insights or conclusions drawn may not be generalizable, since the preferences, behaviors, or needs of consumers in other areas are underrepresented or entirely missing. To ensure more accurate and balanced analysis, it would be necessary to have a more geographically diverse sample.

### Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?  
There is a clear demand-supply gap in the provision of alcohol: 63% of consumers indicate that they drink alcohol, yet only 33% of restaurants currently offer it.

This presents a significant business opportunity to meet unmet consumer demand by increasing alcohol availability in restaurants, potentially boosting customer satisfaction, retention, and overall revenue.

### If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for? 

Based on the dataset, I would invest in a restaurant with the following characteristics: 

- a full bar to meet the high demand for alcohol (63% of consumers drink alcohol)
- parking space to accommodate the 27% of customers who own cars
- no smoking area, as 81% of consumers do not smoke and may be discouraged by its presence
- a medium price range, aligning with the 69% of consumers who have a medium budget
- a menu focused on Mexican cuisine, which is the most preferred among consumers.

### Recommendations:
Investing in restaurants that serve Mexican cuisine is a smart move, as it’s the most preferred choice among consumers. Including a full bar can help meet the high demand for alcohol, which is currently underserved.

A medium pricing strategy is ideal, aligning with the majority of consumers' spending capacity. Avoid smoking areas to appeal to the 81% of customers who do not smoke. Providing parking can help attract car owners and improve customer convenience. 

Since much of the data comes from San Luis Potosí City, exploring less saturated areas could open up new market opportunities. Customer ratings are influenced by how well restaurants meet preferences, so regular feedback should guide improvements. Lastly, tailoring services based on demographics like age and car ownership can enhance engagement and loyalty.
